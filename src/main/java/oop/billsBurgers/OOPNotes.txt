Overloading
    - when a method with same name is used multiple times in same class
    - number, type and sequence of parameters can vary
    - return type CANNOT vary
    - static polymorphism/compilation time

Overriding
    - when a method in subclass has same name as that in parent class
    - method signature must match exactly, i.e. type, number and sequence of arguments
    - private, static and final methods cannot be overridden
    - static method in a subclass may have the same name as that in parent, in which case these are independent-unrelated methods.
    - dynamic polymorphism (runtime)
